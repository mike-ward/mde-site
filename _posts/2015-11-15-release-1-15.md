This release focuses on hyperlinking. I've received feedback about
keyboard shortcuts and helper dialogs for inserting links that I've
taken to heart. A convincing argument persuaded me bend on my, "Avoid
popup dialogs preference".

In this release:

-   Changed `Ctrl+L` to display a dialog for inserting hyperlinks
    (issue \#64). `Ctrl+L` activating a hyperlink dialog is common in
    many online systems. I've modeled my dialog after the one in
    [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

-   Use `Alt-L` to change a selection to an unordered/ordered list

-   Link-pasting - When pasting URL from the clipboard, if something is
    selected in the editor, it's used as the title of the link.

-   Sped up detection of image links by checking the URL extension
    (issue \#64).

-   Force Pandoc to not obfuscate emails (issue \#65)

Keep the feedback coming!
