I think Markdown Edit has grown up enough to warrant its own site. After
all, it is one of the most capable Markdown editors available on the
Windows platform. I chose a vintage typewriter theme as a reminder that
Markdown is first and foremost an editor for writing words.

There's also a new Website address: <http://markdownedit.com>.

And last but not least, release 1.14 of MDE includes:

-   `Ctrl+P` activates the print dialog.
-   Restore focus to the HTML preview on activation.
-   Fix bug when opening `HTML` and `DOCX` files.
