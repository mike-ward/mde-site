#### Documentation

MDE has grown larger than I expected. The first build was only 300 lines
of code! Since then, with the help of many of you, it has become a full
featured Markdown Editor.

However, like many open source projects, the documentation has not kept
pace with the feature set. At one time I thought the editor would be
simple enough that I could just put it all in the `F1` help page. This
is no longer the case.

As such, I've started a wiki on the GitHub repository to document the
many features in earnest. The plan is to reduce the F1 help to keyboard
shortcuts and a link to the wiki.

As happens with many of the programs I write, users know it better than
I do. I welcome additions to the wiki. Last night I roughed out an
[outline of chapters](https://github.com/mike-ward/Markdown-Edit/wiki).
Add as little or as much content as you desire. I'll be filling it out
over the next couple of weeks, but your help is always appreciated.

#### Logo

I added a nag screen about donations. It's easy to shutoff. It's just a
reminder that while free, donations do help. I've started a program in
[VSColorOutput](http://mike-ward.net/vscoloroutput/) where donations of
$25 receive a couple of product stickers mailed to their confirmed
PayPal address.

I'm planning something similar for Markdown Edit. I'm looking for logo
ideas. If you're so inclined, please send me your ideas. I like the,
"Old typewriter/typesetting" theme and would like to lean in that
direction. My wife and daughter (she's an artist) have a cool idea, but
I would like a few more. If I get enough, I'll even run a poll to see
which one you like the best.
