title: "(Almost) Portable Version Released"
---

Version 1.27's major feature is an almost portable version. It's not possible (yet) to make a truly portable .NET (with WPF) version of Markdown Edit. The target system still requires that .NET 4.5.2+ be installed. Perhaps in the future we'll get a version of WPF that is portable. Until then, this is the best I can do.

The number in the toolbar that indicates the number of words in the document can be toggled by clicking on it. It toggles between words, characters, and pages.

Fixed a bug where spell checking was disabled in nested lists (#135).

Updated to the latest versions of Commonmark and AvalonEdit.
