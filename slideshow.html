# Markdown Edit

My Attempt at a Markdown Editor

---

## Modern UI, Minimal Distractions

> MDE is a full-featured Markdown editor for Windows with an emphasis on content and keyboard shortcuts. 

> A real editor, not a watered down text-area or rich-text control

---

## Accurate Syntax Highlighting

> MDE uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to color highlight content. 

> Other editors use regular expressions that don’t correctly interpret the multi-line block nature of Markdown.

---

## Live Preview

> Updates as you type. Handles large documents with ease. 

> User defined templates. 

> MathJax support. 

> Accurate scroll synchronization. 

> CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown supported.

## Reviews

> [PC & Tech Authority](http://downloads.pcauthority.com.au/article/33887-markdown_edit) – An excellent Markdown editor which doesn’t get in your way, yet has plenty of functionality available if you need it.

> [Download Crew](http://www.downloadcrew.com/article/33887-markdown_edit) – An excellent Markdown editor which doesn’t get in your way

> [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/WEB-Design/HTML-Editors/Markdown-Edit.shtml) – It comes with all the options that you would expect from such an application, but what makes it stand out from the crowd is the minimalistic, stylish-looking interface

## Auto Save

When Auto Save is enabled (`Alt+S`), content is saved whenever you pause
typing for 4 or more seconds.

---

## Settings

User settings are stored in a text file in the `AppData` folder. Placing
settings in a plain file allows sharing of settings on different
installations.

Typically, this folder is located at
`C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Markdown Edit\user_settings.json`.
Pressing `F9` will open this file in the system's Notepad editor. It
should look something like this:

``` json
{
    "EditorBackground": "#F7F4EF",
    "EditorForeground": "Black",
    "EditorFontFamily": "Segoe UI",
    "EditorFontSize": 14.0
}
```

When you change settings and save this file, Markdown Edit will
immediately update to reflect the changes.

Colors can be defined as RBG values, like the `EditorBackground`
setting, or using the predefined names (like the `EditorForground`
setting). Acceptable predefined names are listed
[here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.colors(v=vs.110).aspx).

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore it with the default
settings.

---

## Snippets

Snippets allow the quick insertion of words or phrases by typing a
trigger word and then the `TAB` key. This can improve the speed and
proficiency of writing documents. Snippets are stored in a text file
that can be edited by pressing `F6`.

Snippets are activated by typing the trigger word and pressing `TAB`.

Snippets consist of a single line starting with:

-   a single trigger word (can include non alpha-numerics)
-   one or more spaces
-   text that will replace the word

Example

``` json
mde  [Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdown)
```

With this snippet defined, open Markdown Edit and type

``` json
mde[TAB]
```

Where `[TAB]` is the tab key.

The `mde` text is replaced by

``` json
[Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdown)
```

Snippets can contain special keywords.

-   $CLIPBOARD$ - is replaced with clipboard contents (text only)

-   $END$ - Positions the cursor after insertion. For instance

        mde  [Markdown $END$ Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdown)

    positions the cursor between *Markdown* and *Edit*

-   $DATE$ - is replaced with the current date and time

-   $DATE("format")$ - format is any valid .NET date format
    (<http://www.dotnetperls.com/datetime-format>)

-   `\n` - insert a new line

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore it with the default
snippets.

---

## Templates

You can change the appearance of the preview view by changing the user
template file. User templates work similar to user settings. The
template file is stored in the `AppData` Folder as `user_template.html`.
It can be quickly accessed by pressing `F8`. Edit it as you see fit.

It is strongly recommended that you keep the IE9 meta tag in the
`<head>` section.

A `<div>` with an ID of `contents` is required. This is where the
translated markup is inserted into the document.

When you change settings and save this file, Markdown Edit will
immediately update to reflect the changes.

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore the default
template.

---

## Spell Checking

Pressing `F7` will toggle spell checking. Spell checking is done as you
type. Right-click on the word to get suggested spellings or to add to
the dictionary.

The custom dictionary is a simple text file. It stored in the same
folder as the user settings and user templates. It can be accessed and
edited by pressing `Shift+F7`.

Markdown Edit ships with dictionaries for many languages. Set the
dictionary by pressing `F9`. The dictionaries are stored in the
installation folder under `Spell Check\Dictionaries`.

---

## Themes

Markdown Edit has a rudimentary theme system. Themes, control the
appearance of the editor and syntax highlighting. The UI elements (i.e.
dialogs) are not affected.

Out of the box, Markdown comes with several themes which can be accessed
by pressing `Ctrl+T`. Selecting a theme updates your user settings. You
can further edit the theme by opening your user settings (`F9`) and
editing the theme section. This is the recommended way to create a new
theme.

Themes are located in the installation directory under `\Themes`.

If you create an awesome theme, send it to me and I'll add it to the
distribution. I'm a lousy artist. :)
